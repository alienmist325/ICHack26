# Project
We are creating an alternative to Rightmove which validates listings against many sources.

# Dev instructions
- Your instructions are to only update the Python backend. Another developer will handle all of the frontend development.
- For running python and managing dependencies: use uv.
- Use Ruff formatting with `uvx ruff format .`.
- Lint using `uvx ruff check .`.
- Provide type annotations.
